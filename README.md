# 03-Match-3
Made on 2/28/22 for BL-MSCH-C220 at Indiana University .

A Match-3 game made juicier with the addition of different elements.

## Implementation
1. Changed Images (that I took my self of people I know)
2. Changed Typeface and Font
3. Camera shakes when pieces are matched
4. Different pieces have different sound effects when matched (that I recorded myself)
5. New backgrounds for the menu, win, and lose screens
6. Music (that I wrote myself)
7. Pieces get highlighted when you select them
8. Particles radiate off the selected pieces


## References

All of the assets are things I made or images of people that I know that I took.

## Future Development
